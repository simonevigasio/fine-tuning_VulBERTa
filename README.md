# Fine-Tuning a Large Language Model for Vulnerability Detection

Welcome to an exploration of how large-language models (LLMs) can revolutionize static application security testing (SAST). This project investigates how leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies can enhance vulnerability detection, moving beyond traditional syntax-based approaches.

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates the steps to fine-tune a pre-trained large language model for identifying vulnerabilities in software source code. By integrating advanced AI with security principles, the project aims to push the boundaries of static security analysis.
